# Pathfinding Visualizer
Welcome to pathfinding visualizer. I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms after learning about them in CS341, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool as much as I enjoyed creating it. You can access it here: https://pathfindr.netlify.app/.
